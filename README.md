This is a personal training project for the purpose of learning react data visualization and react-hooks.
It is a web application that would display cryptocurrency's data and charts.
You could view and try this app online at https://cryptokaz-ded65.web.app/.

I DID NOT set up a proxy server to handle CORS-Error, so please don't run the app online and locally simultaneously.

It is built with creat-react-app.
To run this app locally, run "npm install" after cloned.
Then run "npm start" to start the application.

This app did not use class based componentes, router and redux
Instead, it's all built with functional componentes and context api
Used lodash to handle complect array manipulation
Used reactHighcharts to act as wrapper for highcharts
Used fuzzy to handle fuzzy search logic
Used moment to handle date calculation

Enjoy :)
