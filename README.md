This is a personal training project for the purpose of learning react data visualization and react-hooks.
It is a web application that would display cryptocurrency's data and charts.
You could view and try this app online at https://cryptokaz-ded65.web.app/.

I DID NOT set up a proxy server to handle CORS-Error. For some reason, firebase did not like cryptocompare api, so please don't run the app online and locally simultaneously.

It is built with creat-react-app.
To run this app locally, run "npm install" after cloned.
Then run "npm start" to start the application.

Enjoy :)
