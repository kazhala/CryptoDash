This is a personal training project for the purpose of learning react data visualization and react-hooks.
It is a web application that would display cryptocurrency's data and charts.
You could view and try this app online at https://cryptokaz-ded65.web.app/.

I DID NOT set up a proxy server to handle CORS-Error. For some reason, firebase did not like cryptocompare api, so please don't run the app online and locally simultaneously.

It is built with creat-react-app.
To run this app locally, run "npm install" after cloned.
Then run "npm start" to start the application.

This app did not use class based componentes, router and redux.
Instead, it's all built with functional componentes and context api.

THE COTRIBUTION FOR THIS PROJECT IS A BIT OFF BECAUSE I FORGOT TO SET UP LOCAL GIT EMAIL....

#Used lodash to handle complex array manipulation.

#Used reactHighcharts to act as wrapper for highcharts.

#Used fuzzy to handle fuzzy search logic.

#Used moment to handle date calculation.

Enjoy :)
